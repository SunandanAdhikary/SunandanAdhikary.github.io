			This work is related to developing a tool for the designing microgrid. This software tool provides high-level guidance to users for selecting grid configuration (essentially the bus architecture), load specification, Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) specification etc. The overall Frontend and Initial Specification Environment of this tool can be divided mainly into two parts: The user specifies the load details and total power to be generated. The tool also provides Microgrid Architecture and Control Strategy selection scope.

This tool also provides a microgrid design from high level design specification with automatic initial design generation and scheduling optimizations for various types of building loads.

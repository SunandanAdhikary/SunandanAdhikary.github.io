My research group Website
Usually static/html websites are hosted by git but this is a php/dynamic website so won't be accessed using [SunandanAdhikary.github.io](https://SunandanAdhikary.github.io).
## How to set up
#### Install WAMP/XAMP/MAMP based on your OS i.e. Win/Linux/MAC
#### Clone/pull this project insite www folder of your  WAMP/XAMP/MAMP installation directory
> whole website folder should be in www folder eg. *C:/wamp64/www/Hiprc_website/* and this will be your **website server root**.
#### Start all services in WAMP/XAMP/MAMP (
> just run it, you can access it in your system tray (beside notifications/shutdown menu) in Win/Linux/MAC.
#### Open your localhost on browser 
> just type [localhost](http://localhost/) in browser url placeholder. *Don't forget to add localhost to bypass proxy if you are behind a proxy network.*
#### In your localhost page go to *add vhosts or add virtual hosts* option and add your project folder path with an alias you want to access it with..
> for example if *C:/wamp64/www/Hiprc_website/* is your project folder and you want to add as virtualhost and *hiprc* be alias you want to access it with then add them in corresponding spaces in add [virtualhosts page](http://localhost/add_vhost.php?lang=english) (add virtual host option will be at left down corner of your localhost page I guess). You can just access the website typing [hiprc](http://hiprc/) in your browser, just like [localhost](http://localhost/).
#### Restart all your services offered by WAMP/XAMP/MAMP and done.
